# AirBnb-House-Rental-Price-Prediction

The AIRBNB dataset contains house rental prices for Los Angeles. It includes homes rented between May 2016 and May 2017. I used
Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Random Forest Regression, Polynomial Regression to predict the prices with lowest RMSE.

# Dataset

The Dataset was taken from the AirBnb website(http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
